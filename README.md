SOLAR SYSTEM
ðŸš€âœ¨I built a Solar System Parallax Website using HTML & CSS, bringing the beauty of space to life with smooth scrolling effects. 
ðŸŒŒ This project was a great way to explore creative web design and front-end development techniques.

ðŸ”¥ Features:

âœ… Parallax scrolling for an immersive 3D-like experience

âœ… Responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices

âœ… Detailed visuals of planets, stars, and space elements

âœ… Smooth animations for a dynamic and engaging UI

Special thanks to TechWing for the inspiration and support throughout this project! ðŸ™Œ
